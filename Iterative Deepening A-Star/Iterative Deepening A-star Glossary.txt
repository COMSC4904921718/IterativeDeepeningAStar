Priority Queue - Queue that orders its items by some priority, for example, cost, before ordering by when the item came into the queue.
Graph - Set of connected nodes.
Dequeue(min) - Takes off the item in the queue with the lowest cost.
Visited - Set of nodes that have been examined.
Neighbors - Nodes that have a direct path to one another.
Goal - Node the algorithm is looking for.
Heuristic - Predefined value that acts like another cost. For example, the cost from the start of a maze to the end if there were no walls.
g(x) - path cost from start to node.
thresh - value that we compare our costs to to determine our next step.
